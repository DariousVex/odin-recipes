  "We live in St. Louis where we have fabulous Italian food," says
  meyerrachelle. "This lasagna could've come from any of the well-known
  restaurants in our area. My family was raving about it! The sauce is
  absolutely amazing! This is definitely a keeper! It lives up to its name."
  "The sweet Italian sausage and ground beef combo along with the sauce were
  very flavorful," says one Allrecipes community member. "Yeah it may take a
  while but it is so worth it. Team it with garlic bread and a salad and you'll
  be very satisfied." "Absolutely phenomenal," raves Amanda Simopoulos. "Fair
  warning: once you've made this, going back to a frozen lasagna will be
  impossible. It is somewhat time consuming but not difficult. My house smells
  delectable every time I make it!

  <li>1/2 cup water</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parley, divided</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
  <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
  <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
  <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
  <li>
    Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
    heat until well browned.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with
    sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning,
    fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring
    occasionally.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in
    boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons
    parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
  </li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
  <li>
    To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
    baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2
    of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
    Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup
    Parmesan cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover
    with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make
    sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
    additional 25 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
