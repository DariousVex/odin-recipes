  "Absolutely delicious and easy," raves the1betsy. "I used finely chopped sweet
  onions and cooked them until translucent in the bacon drippings before
  draining and adding them. Raves from the family!" "I made this recipe today
  with leftover baked potatoes," says Patti. "It was super easy and turned out
  great. My family loved it." "This soup is delicious," according to Alice
  Russell Fulton. "My family loved it. Not difficult, but I would suggest baking
  the potatoes a day or more ahead to save time."
